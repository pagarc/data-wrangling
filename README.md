# Data Wrangling in Python
I practiced data wrangling skills such as merging, aggregating, subsetting, and summarizing with the pandas Python library using data from Open Data DC and the American Community Survey, looking for a relationship between average income in DC and the frequency of 311 requests. I presented the results in a Jupyter notebook with a brief data science report before the Python code, and I also visualized the data with scatterplots.
